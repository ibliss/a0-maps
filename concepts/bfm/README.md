# Tracks:

## Key:
* Track implemented  
! May not be possible, see note

## all_bfm
All BFMs in one map, provides a way to practice going through all BFMs.

## barrel_roll_0
A standard "1g" barrel roll which has no lateral or vertical displacement.

## barrel_roll_attack


## barrel_roll_high_g_high


## barrel_roll_high_g_low


## canopy_roll
Barrel roll with altitude loss.  
Roll 180, continue barrel.

## defensive_spiral
Barrel roll in the vertical

## high_yoyo


## immelmann
Reverse direction, gain altitude, lose speed.

## loop
Vertical loop, maintain altitude, direction, and speed.  
! May be a problem with vertical reversals

## low_yoyo
Dive to gain speed, pop up at the end.

## scissors
Extreme lateral movement, as slow as possible without loosing alt.  
Track idea: put rocks in front of gates.

## split_s
Reverse direction, lose altitude, gain speed.

## turn_oblique
Out of plane maneuver above the horizon.

## turn_slice
Out of plane maneuver below the horizon.

## wingover
Reverse direction, maintain alt. & speed.
